\# Handling Cloud Security



Organizations typically have different teams, or sometimes different individuals, handling cloud security (think proactive protection, like posture management, vulnerability management, data protection, and identity management) and enterprise security operations (or SecOps), which is typically reactive (think remediating threats and vulnerabilities after the fact.)



\- SCC is a multi-cloud security solution

\- Mostly proactive: Posture management, vulnerability management, data protection, identity management, (threat detection)

\- Mostly reactive: Threat management, incident response.

\- SCC helps organization prevent, detect, and respond to security risks.



\# Security Command Center



\- Cloud first risk management solution

\- Groups cloud risks into cases for easier prioritization and management

\- Offers

&nbsp;	- Proactive discovery/scanning of cloud environment

&nbsp;	- Determines potential impact and priority level of risks identified

&nbsp;	- Creates cases with grouped incidents

&nbsp;	- Enrich cases with correlated data

&nbsp;	- Leverages Gemini AI to simplify analysis

&nbsp;	- Includes support for automation with playbooks 



\- SCC helps analyst focus on cases rather than individual, isolated findings



\# Core functionality 



\## Cloud Security Posture Management (SPM)



\- Means assess your environment, combing and validating configurations, software, and compliance rules.

\- The goal is to uncover hidden misconfigurations that lead to system, software, or environment-level vulnerabilities.

\- SCC tools for SPM:

&nbsp;	- Eyes on the Ground 

&nbsp;	- Zeroing in on hazards

&nbsp;	- Prioritizing for Efficient Response



\## Continuous Risk Engine (CRE)



\- Helps keep your organization at the same level of sophistication and change of attacker's tactics and techniques.

\- CRE helps prioritize risks that could affect your cloud environment (proactive)

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	- CRE maps and highlights the most critical assets that require the higher attention

&nbsp;	- CRE mimics real-world tactics and techniques to validate your cloud security posture

&nbsp;	- CRE supports advanced behavioral scans to identify intricate methods to vuln your cloud environment

&nbsp;	- CRE scores risks to help you prioritize

&nbsp;	- CRE dashboards provides a high-level overview of the big picture of your cloud security posture



\### CRE Attack Path Simulation (APS) feature



\- CRE supports advanced behavioral scans and red team automated simulations to validate the security posture of your cloud environment.

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	- APS generates a map (diagram) of your cloud environment

&nbsp;	- Simulations are run in non-live cloud instances

&nbsp;	- Simulations probe different tactics and techniques that adversaries might try to attempt, like sneaking to high-value assets like databases or storage areas.





\## SOAR



\- SCC supports a SOAR similar to Chronicle SOAR



\## Gemini AI



\- Support for Gemini AI. Offers plaintext summaries in common language, without tech slang.

\- Helps describe risk scenarios and threats.



\## Wrap up



\- **Discovers proactively**: SCC surveys your cloud environment for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and active threats, providing detailed visibility and actionable intelligence to prioritize and fix issues.

\- **Integrates with Risk Engine**: which provides a comprehensive and continuous view of cloud risks, and prioritizes events so top risks can be addressed quickly by the right teams.

\- **Provides attack path simulation:** which acts as your counterintelligence to expose the enemy's route before they attack.

\- **Integrates with Chronicle SOAR**: which helps resolve security issues faster by eliminating the backlog of unresolved risks with integrated workflows that connect threat prevention, detection, and response actions.

\- **Detects multi-cloud threats**: you have Google's vast capabilities scaling up your protection to AWS and Azure environments

\- **Integrates with Gemini**: your tireless AI analyst combs through mountains of data to safeguard your city.
